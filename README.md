# New FSJS project 2

## List Pagination and Filter - v2 - Data version

### Intro

In the original List Pagination and Filter project, you paginated a list of DOM elements in an HTML file.

In this new version, you'll start with:

* An `index.html` with just a few basic starting elements
* New styles in a `css/styles.css` file that includes instructions on how to easily customize the app colors
* A `js/data.js` file containing an array of 42 student objects and a helper function for formatting dates
* A `js/script.js` file where you'll write your code

You'll use the data in the `js/data.js` file to populate the DOM and display ten students and functioning pagination links.  This will be similar to what you did in the original List Pagination and Filter project.  You'll create and define showPage and appendPageLink functions.  But instead of just manipulating the DOM with those functions, you'll use data to build out and display the DOM.

### Instructions

Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  Follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete the project.  If you get stuck and/or when you're done, please DM @robertpm in Slack.

Best of luck, happy coding and thanks for your help! :)
